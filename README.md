# CS315-Project2
Worm Game: ASCII Characters at the command line

Created by Sean Kozina in Fall 2022
As my second project of my "Data Structures" class
it supposed to show understanding of using a circular queue 
on top of a 2D Matrix

When starting the game the player can control the worm using WASD
and move around to collect "Fruit" labeled "f" in order to increase the length of the worm
if the worm ever comes in contact with the edge of the grid or the worm itself the game ends
